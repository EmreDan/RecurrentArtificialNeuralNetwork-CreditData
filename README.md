# RecurrentArtificialNeuralNetwork-CreditData
--> Binary Classification with Artificial Neural Network. <--

In this project Elman Simple Recurrent Network with 1 hidden layer is used to design and implement binary classification.

Data set (credit data) is a sample data for binary classification where class=”yes” is the positive type. 

For weight updates error back-propagation is used. 

As the non-linear output activation function Sigmoid function is used. 

Stratified cross-validation with 10 folds is used.
